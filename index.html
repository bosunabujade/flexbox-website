        I am a <span>Responsive Designer & Developer</span> who thrives on visual
        storytelling. When i'm not working, pursuing side projects or getting lost in the
          rabbit hole of blogs & books, I can be found traveling, hiking and searching for
          new stories.

        <p>
          I was born and rasied in NYC, but my real roots reach to South
          America. I owe my travel bug to being a first generation American
          with family all over the world - we were always on the go!

        <p>
          <span>My Passion:</span> I LOVE music -it's one of the most powerful
          and diverse methods for expresion & communication. In the meantime,
           I get my fix by going to lots and lots of concerts. I'm at 160 and
           counting!

        <p>
          <span>A fun fact:</span> As a true New Yorker, I'm slightly embarrased
          to say that i only learned how to ride a plain ol' stationary bike 1 year ago, and have
          yet to learn to drive. But, the real takeaway is that i'm learning!
